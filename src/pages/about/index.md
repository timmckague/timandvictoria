Hi and welcome to our blog! We are Tim and Victoria, adventurers from Toronto, Canada. 

We created this blog for three reasons:

1. For us: a place to document our adventures together to help us remember our fun experiences
2. For our friends and family: a way to keep friends and family updated on our current travels through Europe
3. For fellow adventurers: a resource for like-minded people who might stumble upon our blog looking for some ideas or practical tips from places weâ€™ve been

Our favourite type of holiday is a multi-day hiking trip, with a road trip thrown in the mix as well. There is something really special about having to work for your view, especially one that feels a little off the beaten path. That being said, we also love traveling to cities too! Over the next few months we are travelling through parts of Europe, and definitely doing more city travel vs off the beaten path.

Thanks for stopping by and taking part in our adventures with us :)
