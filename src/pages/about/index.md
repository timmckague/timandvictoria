Hi and welcome to our blog! We are Tim and Victoria, adventurers from Toronto, Canada. 

We like all sorts of adventures - whether it's multi-day hiking treks, city exploring, road-trips, or soaking up the sun by a lake or ocean. Most importantly, we love being outside, and enjoying the time with each other, family, and friends!

Thanks for stopping by and taking part in our adventures with us :)
