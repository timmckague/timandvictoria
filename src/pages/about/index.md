Hi and welcome to our blog! We are Tim and Victoria, adventurers from Toronto, Canada. 

We created this blog for three reasons:

1. For us: a place to document our adventures together in order to help us savour and reflect on our experiences
2. For our friends and family: a way to keep friends and family updated on our current travels through Europe
3. For fellow adventurers: a resource for like-minded people who might stumble upon our blog looking for some ideas or practical tips for places weâ€™ve been

We like all sorts of adventures - from multi-day hiking treks, to city exploring, road-trips, and soaking up the sun by a lake or ocean. 

Thanks for stopping by and taking part in our adventures with us :)
