Porto borders the Douro River, which lends itself to some great running routes. We became creatures of habit with our running routes in Porto, either running down, up or across the river. Here are some pictures from our excursions so that you can run along with us!

## Down the Douro River

Distance: 10.5km

What luck we had this particular morning catching the beautiful mist on the river! Only 10 minutes later it was all cleared up, so I’m glad we made it out when we did!

Looking West at the Ponte Luis I, in the direction of our run for the day.

Looking back East at the Ponte do Infante.

We make our way down to the water. I’m happy to be on the flat!

We are just a little over 1km from home, but the 80m climb up these stairs (Escada dos Guindais) stand between us. I love these stairs, but I also hate these stairs.

## Up the Douro River

Distance: 7.5km

Looking West at the many bridges that span the Douro River.

We make the steep drop down to the water, this time on Calçada das Carquejeiras to change things up from the usual stairs.

The many bridges that span the Douro River make for great mental goals while running. When running East we always set our sights on the Ponte do Freixo, 2.5km from the Ponte Luís where we ascend back up the cliff. You can see the Ponte Luís I in the distance below.
