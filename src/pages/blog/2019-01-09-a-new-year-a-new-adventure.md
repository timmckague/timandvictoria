# What Are we Doing Here?

We've spent the last 5 days in Lisbon, Portugal. To understand how we ended
up in Lisbon you've got to know a few things about us.

1. We don't really want to be cold
2. We haven't seen much of Europe
3. We like port...

## Avoiding The Cold

We're Canadian. Cold isn't the worst thing, but if can be avoided, why not!

## Seeing Europe

We've established that cold avoidance was a driving factor in our decision making.
There are many places you could go in the World to avoid the cold, but we choose Europe.
We haven't seen much of Europe together so why check it now! Having established that we
wanted to see Europe together a quick look at a map showed that Portugal is positioned
nicely south, providing a strong chance of achieving that cold avoid goal while still
being in Europe.

## Bonus: Flights to Lisbon Seemed Fairly Cheap!

We don't always fly, but when we do, we fly direct...

Thats a lie, but its certainly our aspiration in the case of getting to Lisbon
our reality.

It was settled, we had the foundation of a plan.

## Success Achieved?

You're likely thinking, "Lisbon is not that warm in January you fool!"...

If you thought that you're right! Where were you 2 months ago when this idea jumped
in to our heads?

It may not be the warmest place but its also not sub-zero (C) with snow. In fact
it occupies a really nice range of temperatures 5C - 15C, which in our view achieves
the goal of _avoiding the cold_. We won't be sweating, but that OK, we didn't set
out on this trip to sweat, just to avoid the cold. Goal achieved!

We're in Europe! Goal achieved!

As mentioned, cheap & direct flights! Not really a driving goal, but certainly
important. Goal Achieved!

Did we mention that we love Port? Well we do! Bonus Goal!
