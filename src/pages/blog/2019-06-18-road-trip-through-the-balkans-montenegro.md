## Our itinerary

You can drive across the entirety of Montenegro in less time than it takes to drive from Toronto to Ottawa, but it still packs in a lot to see and experience. 

Hereâ€™s a snapshot of our week in Montenegro.

* Day 1: Drive from Dubrovnik to Kotor, and explore old town
* Day 2: Kotor hike and Lovcen sunset picnic
* Day 3: Beach day at Petrovac, and sunset dinner in Tivat
* Day 4: Work day in Kotor
* Day 5: Drive from Kotor to Durmitor National Park and check out Tara Canyon
* Day 6: Watch the rain and sleet from our window :(
* Day 7: Drive through a harrowing canyon on our way to Bosnia
