After ten day in Lisbon, we were feeling settled enough to take a day trip outside of the city. We could have travelled out earlier, but we both really enjoyed the slowness of our first ten days in the city. 

Cascais is a coastal resort town known for its beaches. Despite it being winter, we figured it would be beautiful nonetheless (and we were not disappointed!). We rented bikes and travelled  to the most Westernly beach with bike trail access, Praia Grande do Guincho, enjoying the coastal sights along the way. 

Getting to Cascais from Lisbon was very easy and affordable. We walked down to the Cais to Sodre train station, each loaded up our Viva Viagem card (sort of like a presto card) with our tickets, and hopped on the 9:40am train. After 40min of coastal views we arrived in Cascais. 

Disembarking from the train we quickly located the city bike rental kiosk across the roundabout from the train station. After exchanging mine three times to get one that had enough air in the tires and didn’t make annoying sounds, we set off to the coast. The coastal views were beautiful as we biked the 10km to Praia Grande do Guincho, the furthest beach accessible by the bike path.

We had perfect weather for a winter trip to the beach! There wasn’t a cloud in the sky, and we quickly found ourselves stripping down to just our t-shirts. The path is mostly flat, with a few sections that have a slight gradient. I’m guessing we wouldn’t have normally noticed the gradient, but with a single speed and not enough air in one of our bikes, we felt all the hills. Even in January, the path was crowded at certain spots with walkers, strollers, runners and other bikers, but, for the most part we had a very leisurely ride out to Grande do Guincho beach.

The ride to the beach was well worth it. There were a number of brave souls in full-body wetsuits surfing, but mostly people walking the beach enjoying the sun.

On our way home, we pulled over a few times to pause and take in the view along the coast. We ended up dropping off our bikes at one of the bike rental locations a couple of kilometres outside of town, allowing us to more leisurely experience the last of the sun. A highlight was finding a secluded spot along the coast to sit on the edge of the cliff and watch the sun go down.

After the sun went down, Cascais became very quiet. Most Portuguese restaurants tend not to open for dinner until 7pm, so that could have been why it seemed so quiet. We grabbed a quick bite to eat (nothing to write home about), and jumped on the 20:00 train home to Lisbon. Cascais made for a great day trip, but definitely shined during the day, not at night. 

In summary, taking a day trip to Cascais was a great way to spend a Sunday. When travelling, there is something special about taking a little mini vacation within the vacation, and Cascais did not disappoint.
