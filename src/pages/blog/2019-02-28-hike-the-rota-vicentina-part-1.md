Thanks to the recommendation from our good friend Kyrie we embarked on a four-day hike along Portugal’s southwestern coast. Over the four days we hiked 88km along the Rota Vicentina, experiencing the Alentejo region’s beautiful cliffs, beaches, and small towns. We really enjoyed the peacefulness of the trail and the opportunity it gave us to just be. We took in the sights, chatted, felt the sun on our faces, got lost in our own thoughts…

## Getting to the trailhead

Tuesday, 6:45am. We left our apartment and walked downhill to the Saint Apoliana train station to catch the metro. Tuesday and Saturday is market day in the Alfama neighbourhood and as we made our way down to the station we witnessed all the vendors setting up for the day. We were amazed at the extensiveness of the market!

We felt light and free as we walked through the streets with just our small daypacks which contained all our necessities for the next four days. 

We boarded the metro and hoped for no delays. We were cutting it close for our 7:30am bus departure to Cercal.

7:20am. Metro arrived at Jardim Zoologico. We exited the train, followed the crowd outside, and then proceeded to walk/run almost a full circle around the block trying to locate the bus stop.

7:25am. We found the bus station, but what bus was ours? We didn’t recognize any of the cities on the tiny departures screen. With a small line-up at the ticket desk, and little time for mistakes we lined-up to get help. The ticket agent didn’t speak much English, but from showing her our online tickets she was able to motion that we needed to print out tickets from a nearby machine. 

“Quick! Over there to the machine before there is a line up!”

I read aloud the reservation number as Tim punched them in.

“0-9-2-2-0”

Printing…

7:28am. We grabbed our tickets which conveniently revealed our bus number and dashed over to the row of buses. Two minutes to spare! 

We love that feeling of making it aboard the bus/train/plane. The relief of making it, and the anticipation of the trip ahead! 

## Day 1: Cercal to Vila de Milfontes

Starting town: Cercal

Ending town: Vila de Milfontes

Distance hiked: 31km

Trail time: 10:40 to 19:00

We left the town of Cercal, and hiked through its outskirts, passing small farms and walking up a bit of a hill from which we looked over Cercal behind us.

We then walked through a eucalyptus forest, followed by a cork oak forest. Apparently the bark can be removed without killing the tree, and re-harvested every nine years.

The first half of the day was easy walking on the Historical Way portion of the trail. The ground was compact and the path wide. The navigation was fairly easy as well, for the most part. At one point we arrived at a pasture, and distracted by the cows, turned west toward the coast a little too early. This navigation error meant we had to hike a kilometre on the highway to rejoin with the trail. I’m glad it wasn’t longer on the road - there was no shoulder and the traffic was constant and fast moving.

15.5km and 3.5hrs later the Historical Way intersected with the Fisherman’s Trail at the coast. It felt so good to be at the ocean, but I could have called it a day by then, and couldn’t believe we were only half-way done for the day. It doesn’t help that by this point I’ve discovered that my hiking boots aren’t as comfortable as they once were, and I could feel big blisters developing.

Happy that we had made it halfway, we took a water break and gave our feet some fresh ocean air. However, knowing that the sun would set at 6:10pm we don’t stop for more than a few minutes before getting on our way. We had just under 4hrs of sunlight left, and 16km to go.

The walking was fast and easy on the Historical Way, but such was not the case in the afternoon on the Fisherman’s Trail. The rest of the day we walked over soft sand - the kind where it feels like for every step forward you are also taking a step backwards. The upside of the sand though was that it was softer on my sore feet. 

Some of the trail sections in the afternoon had smaller cliffs and so we were close to the water level. At one point we were able to walk along the beach.

The last last 30 minutes before sunset was my favourite part of the day. We were still on the cliffs, with not a soul in sight, and it was breathtaking to see the landscape change colours as the sun set over the ocean. The small succulents plants that flourished in the sand burned red in the glow of the sun.

We arrived to our lodgings promptly at 7pm. The last section through town was one of the toughest of the day, as the pavement was hard on our feet, and we were in complete darkness by the end. What a relief to have made it!

The hot shower felt oh so good. The food at dinner was so-so, but, as Michael would say, there’s nothing like food when you’re hungry! 

It was a wonderful day full of beautiful views, great conversation, a little bit of pain, but mostly smiles and laughs. A perfect way to spend our 8th year dating anniversary.

## Day 2: Vila de Milfontes to Almograve

Starting town: Vila de Milfontes

Ending town: Almograve

Distance hiked: 16.5km

Trail time: 12:00 to 17:30

It was certainly a new day, but my feet begged to differ about “feeling good”. Our host very kindly made us breakfast, and as we heard her door open we sprang out of bed to meet her for our pre-arranged 8:30am delivery. 

We enjoyed breakfast outside on our little terrace. Mid-morning the sun hit the terrace and, knowing we had a shorter hiking day ahead of us, we lingered a little longer reading our books soaking up the sun with our feet up. 

Time ticked on, and eventually it was time to hit the road. The walk leaving town was gruelling. It felt like my blisters hadn’t recovered at all from the previous day, and the asphalt start certainly didn’t help. I even questioned whether I would be able to make it to Almograve, and considered for a moment getting a taxi. Tempting as it was, I knew I couldn’t give up on the second day, so on we went. 

After the asphalt stretch leaving Vila de Milfontes we had a nice section along the coast. 

The rest of the day though turned out to be a little disappointing view-wise compared to the previous day. Although we were near the coast most of the day, a lot of it was spent just behind the sand dunes with the ocean out of sight, or walking through thick growths of acacia trees. In one patch we had to crouch down on our knees to make it through the thick growth. The trail definitely needed some pruning!

This wasn’t the worst of it, but gives a sense at the thickness of the acacia trees.

I’ve heard that slow and steady wins the race. We didn’t win any races, but we did eventually make it to Almograve. We picked up some cold cervajas on our way to our AirBnB and enjoyed the refreshing drink and the satisfaction of another great day.

Coming soon our post on days three and four of our hiking adventure!
