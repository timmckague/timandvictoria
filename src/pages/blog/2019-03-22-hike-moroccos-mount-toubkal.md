“Yallah! Yallah!” Sabir calls out.

Breaktime is over, time to get a move on. We tighten our water bottles lids and sling our packs over our shoulders.

We’ve been hiking for 3 hours and we’re feeling good. All in we expect to hike for 5 to 6 hours today, covering 12.5km and ascending \~1500m to the refuge that sits at \~3200m.

As we start to climb again we’re still feeling uncertain about having a guide, 24 hours ago we were really excited to be doing the hike by ourselves, no guide. This excitement to self guide was actually a bit of a twist, because 48 hours prior (and before that even) we were certain that we’d do the hike through a tour company that would arrange all the food, hire a mule to carry our bags and guide to lead us up the mountain!

At the time there were a number of factors at play that made us quite certain that we would do the hike through a tour company.

1. It sounded like the hike would be really difficult from all the blog posts we read
2. It was winter in the Atlas mountains which in turn could mean challenging weather
3. It sounds like it was very remote from the blog posts we read
4. We don’t speak the local language
5. As we planned the trip we had a general nervousness and uncertainty about every aspect of Morocco, again highly influenced by nearly every blog post we read.
6. There was a gruesome terrorist attack in December against two hikers on this trail. 

As we arrived in Imlil, the starting point for the hike, nearly all of our fears/concerns disappeared. I’m not exactly sure why they all disappeared so quickly, maybe it was the unexpected sun and warmth, maybe it was the Riad’s mint tea? Maybe our confidence was high as a result of actually getting a petit taxi to use the meter instead of gouging us with some absurd flat rate (props to Grace Osler!). Whatever it was, we had convinced ourselves that a guide would not be needed! Woohoo!

# Is that so…

As we left the Riad to go rent some crampons, Hussain, the owner of the Riad, upon hearing our plans to self guide casually let us know that since the attack in December there were police control points along the trail and we would not be permitted to pass without a guide.

The sad reality for us travelling in Morocco, is that we trust no one. This again influenced heavily by the blog posts we read in preparation for the trip and as well from a few experiences with Moroccan cab drivers. As a side note, after spending the 2 weeks in Morocco, I think that feeling is only somewhat justified, we met many people here that were very nice to us and that we don’t think we were trying to scam us in any way! 

We decide that we need to validate this new information because it sounds like a great way to try and sell a guides services. The first person we check this information with is Ibrahim, the man renting us crampons. He re-confirms the story, but we don’t really trust his account either because he subsequently starts trying to sell us guide services. We need someone else to confirm the story, we recall passing a police check point at the entrance of the town. 

Who better to ask then the Police? They are the ones enforcing this new rule at their checkpoints. Fortunately for us, Grace is travelling Morocco with us and she speaks excellent french, so we volunteer her to take point on asking the police whether it is in fact law to have a guide escort you up the mountain. The Police give us the same story, with an extra detail, the guide just has to be a local person. The police officer then seems to start to make an attempt to sell us a guide, but catches himself part way and simply bids us farewell.

We still don’t trust that this “guide” requirement is real but we also don’t like the idea of making it part way up the mountain only to get turned back because we don’t have a guide.

# To the Refuge

This brings us back to Sabir, “Yallah”ing us up the mountain (Yallah = “come on/hurry up”). We hired a guide… skipped the mules, hence why we’re carrying our own packs and figured we could arrange our own food and shelter at the refuge.

Hiking to the refuge is not particularly challenging (technically speaking) as there is a clear trail that is very well marked and not at all remote. There are about 4 - 5 huts dotting the path up to the refuge all selling drinks, food and souvenirs (I’m not sure who buys the souvenirs…)

We make it to the refuge at 3pm. In Morocco they are very generous with their mint tea, whenever you arrive somewhere mint tea is served immediately and the refuge was no exception. As we sat outside the refuge sipping our tea we couldn't help but feel great as we took in the snow capped peaks, the sound of the brook nearby and felt the sun’s warmth on our backs. 

There was a fairly steady stream of hikers making their way to refuge as we overlooked the valley. One set of hikers was a couple from France who encountered the requirement to hire a guide with even more skepticism then us, as they tried to climb without a guide. When they hit the first checkpoint the story was confirmed, they were turned back to find a guide.



# To the Summit

We left the refuge around 6am to ascend to the peak. It was dark and cold as we stepped outside the refuge putting our crampons on. The rest of the way up would involve climbing up a snow/ice covered slope. 

With our headlights on we started up the mountain. As we looked up mountain ahead of us we could see the headlights of the groups of hikers that left before us. It was as though the trail was marked with lights showing us the way.

Stars still filled the sky as we weaved our way up but didn’t quite give enough to climb without our headlights on. The only sound was crunch and squeak of snow and ice under our crampons and hiking poles. We were all thankful to have crampons, the ascent would have been really difficult without them. 

As we neared the peak, the wind picked up and the temperature dropped. Our bags were feeling quite light as we were wearing all our layers. I was happy that I packed long underwear, they had not seen much action on the trip previously but they earned their spot in my bag on this hike!

At the peak, the thin air became more noticeable. Our pace was feeling like a crawl but if we went any faster and we’d quickly be gasping for breath.

“Say tagine!” We all smile as we pose at the top of Toubkal for a group photo. We made it! The worst is behind us and gravity will be on our side. 

Who doesn’t enjoy the view from the top of a mountain. Toubkal is not the highest mountain in Africa, but at 4,167m it lays claim the “North Africa’s” tallest peak.

The descent back to Imlil was tougher then expected and we were all relieved and happy to make it back to the Riad for a nice warm shower followed by the customary mint tea.
