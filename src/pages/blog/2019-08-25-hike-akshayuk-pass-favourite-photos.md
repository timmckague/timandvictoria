Today marks 1 year from when we completed our 100km traverse through Akshayuk Pass in Auyuittuq National Park, Nunavut, Canada. 

Eleven days after leaving the northern community of Qikiqtarjuaq, we reached the Nunavut flag marking the southern point of the 100km traverse. I recall feeling elated from the sense of accomplishment, relieved that we completed the trek with no medical emergencies, and excited at the prospect of a hot shower. 

However, I mostly felt a sense of sadness from having to say goodbye to the place we called home for the past 11 days.

Goodbye to the majestic mountains.\
Goodbye to the Penny Ice Cap and it numerous glaciers.\
Goodbye to the rumbling moraines.\
Goodbye to the gigantic mosquitoes.\
Goodbye to the arctic hare and fox.\
Goodbye to the punishing glacial river crossings. \
Goodbye to the never sleeping sun.

Although it was goodbye to the place, it wasn’t goodbye to the people we had become. We carried out with us our new sense of wonder, new challenges overcome, new memories made together, and a new appreciation for the small things (like a hot cup of tea!). 

To mark the anniversary of this trip of a lifetime, here are our **TOP TEN photos from the trek** that show a glimpse of the beauty of the north. 

**1. Setting out**

We started our trek at the north end of the Pass, 2.5 hours by boat from the remote village of Qik. Over the next 11 days we would be traversing the entirety of the Akshayuk Pass, starting from the North Pangnirtung Ford. Few hikers attempt the full traverse, and so the northern section of the hike is less traveled, and as a result, has no worn path. 

The lack of path added to the uniqueness of the northern section of the hike - there was an immense sense of remoteness and an untouched pristine beauty to the landscape.

**2. Wildflowers along the Owl River**

Don’t be fooled by the easy looking terrain in the photo above! The grass-looking terrain was a mossy bog that would envelop our feet whole with every step. With the weight of our packs every step forward felt like emerging from a mud pit.

These wildflowers were a welcome sight! Not only were they beautiful and unexpected in the harsh landscape and conditions (the temperature ranged from -3 to +8 during our hike), but they also indicated easier walking underfoot. The flowers thrived in sandy terrain, and the hard packed sand was a breeze to walk on compared to the sinking tundra moss.

**4. Vastness**

The broad valley and lack of path are unique features to the Northern section of the pass. 

Despite the lack of path, navigation was easy through this Northern section of the valley, sticking to the East bank of the Owl River. Four days later we would be crossing the Owl River and then following the Weasel River for the remainder of the trek.

**5. Family shot**

From the smiles in this pic you wouldn’t guess how heavy our packs were! This was from Day 1, meaning we had 13 days of food on our backs (this includes extra meals in case we were stuck longer than expected at river crossings waiting for water flow to slow). Our packs were so heavy these first few days that Campbell or Tim had to hoist our packs up for us and we would slip into them like stepping into a coat.

**6. A windy day**

On our second day the wind came in and howled at us all day. It was so strong that we walked duck style to cut the wind, taking turns being lead bird. Silver lining of the strong winds? The mosquitoes took respite and we enjoyed some buzz free moments.

**7. Camp at the end of the Owl River**

Night four on the trek we camped at the base of Mount Battle, where the Owl River ends. 

Previously in the afternoon we spent an hour unsuccessfully attempting to cross the Owl River. This was our first “primary concern” river crossing, and we were fooled into thinking we could cross it in the afternoon, despite knowing it was the hardest time to cross as the sun had been beating down all day, melting the glaciers and increasing the flow of water. The river spanned 400m, and with 10m to go we had to turn back. The water was too deep and too fast to make it the final stretch. So close! 

We trudged back the 390m and set up camp in the sun amidst the mountains and arctic cotton tufts. The next morning we triumphed and successfully crossed the river at 2am.
