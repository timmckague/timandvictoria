We both really enjoyed the slowness of our first ten days in Lisbon. Reading, walking, running, observing, reflecting, some work, learning...the change of spending more time on these activities feels good.

The course I am taking “The Science of Well-Being” by Laurie Santos, a professor at Yale, talks about how we have this annoying trait of hedonic adaptation. We get used to things, and so over time they don’t make us as happy as they once did. In this week’s lectures she talks about several ways to overcome this annoying feature of hedonic adaptation, of which two of them are:

1. Interrupt your consumption
2. Increase your variety

These resonated with me in regards to how Tim and I have been spending our time, or more accurately, how we’ve been spending our time somewhat differently than we do at home. 

Without the distractions of the to-do list from home (e.g. cleaning, sorting, de-cluttering) we now have so much more time to read our books, observe the world around us, spend hours talking with each other, absorb ourselves in our work, etc. 

At home, one of my favourite way to spend my time is with family and friends: a sleepover, shared meal, run, hike, walk, games night, facetime call, etc. I miss this time together, but if I take the perspective of “interrupting my consumption” and “increasing my variety”, then maybe I will enjoy time with friends and family even more upon my return, and likewise, I am appreciating the opportunity spend more time on activities like reading, reflecting, learning.

Going forward, how do I make sure that we don’t experience hedonic adaptation to travelling? Only two weeks into our travels everything is still feeling new and fresh, but something to make sure we reflect on. I know how easy it is to adapt a new reference point, and forget what it was like to be working 50+ hours a week, commuting over two hours a day, and feeling like you can do little more than sleep, work, eat, and then repeat.

Have you ever experienced this phenomenon of hedonic adaptation? How have you overcome it?
