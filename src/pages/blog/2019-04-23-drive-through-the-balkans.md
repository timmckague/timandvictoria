## What will you remember?

Over dinner last night, Tim asked “_Ten or twenty years from now, what do you think you will remember about this trip?_”

Many great moments came to mind…

* Starting our day in Lisbon reading our books in a coffee shop (how luxurious on a weekday!)
* Experiencing unexpected kindness from a stranger when we locked ourselves out of our Lisbon apartment 
* Finding the perfect wall from which to watch the sunset in Porto, chips and beer in hand
* Enjoying daily double espressos at our favourite coffee shop in Porto 
* Watching the sunset on the cliffs of the Rota Vicentina after walking  30km in a day
* Playing pre-dinner euchre with Jan and Bill in Lagos 
* Eating tapas to our hearts’ content in Seville
* Venturing into uncertain territory in Morocco but feeling the comfort and thrill of sharing the experience with Grace
* Sharing coffee and baklava and a 30min conversation entirely through google translate with our hosts in a small town in Bosnia
* Getting to know a Slovenian woman over tacos in Ljubljana, and then being invited to gelato and a tour of the city
* Eating a traditional Slovenian Easter in the mountains, compliments of our Airbnb hosts
* And even the present conversation, over candlelight and homemade vodka in a Slovenian village of less than 100 people

Tim doesn’t have much confidence in his memory of the specifics...“_Other than what you remind me about, I don’t think I’ll remember many specific events 20 years from now._”

What he thinks will stick with him though is how we both felt on the trip - totally care-free, open-minded, present in the here and now, and sharing and enjoying the experience together.

What he said reminded me of a quote I had read:
