## What will you remember?

Over dinner last night, Tim asked “_Ten or twenty years from now, what do you think you will remember about this trip?_”

Many great moments came to mind…

* Starting our day in Lisbon reading our books in a coffee shop (how luxurious on a weekday!)
* Experiencing unexpected kindness from a stranger when we locked ourselves out of our Lisbon apartment 
* Finding the perfect wall from which to watch the sunset in Porto, chips and beer in hand
* Enjoying daily double espressos at our favourite coffee shop in Porto 
* Watching the sunset on the cliffs of the Rota Vicentina after walking  30km in a day
* Playing pre-dinner euchre with Jan and Bill in Lagos 
* Eating tapas to our hearts’ content in Seville
* Venturing into uncertain territory in Morocco but feeling the comfort and thrill of sharing the experience with Grace
* Sharing coffee and baklava and a 30min conversation entirely through google translate with our hosts in a small town in Bosnia
* Getting to know a Slovenian woman over tacos in Ljubljana, and then being invited to gelato and a tour of the city
* Eating a traditional Slovenian Easter in the mountains, compliments of our Airbnb hosts
* And even the present conversation, over candlelight and homemade vodka in a Slovenian village of less than 100 people

Tim doesn’t have much confidence in his memory of the specifics...“_Other than what you remind me about, I don’t think I’ll remember many specific events 20 years from now._”

What he thinks will stick with him though is how we both **_felt_** on the trip - totally care-free, open-minded, present in the here and now, and sharing and enjoying the experience together.

What he said reminded me of a quote I had read:

> “I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” - Maya Angelou 

Tim’s probably right that, except for where pictures, journals and blog posts exist, many specifics may fade (or become embellished!) over time. But, in the vein of Maya Angelou’s quote, we may never forget the feelings.

## Strong opinions, loosely held

We love how this trip has evolved as we experience new things, moving with the ebbs and flows of how we are feeling in the here and now, and keeping our mind open to changing plans and new experiences. 

At the start of our trip we felt like travelling slowly and “living” in new cities instead of visiting them briefly. We enjoyed Porto so much that we extended our stay by another week. As  February came around, we craved a little more adventure, so organized a four-day hiking trip. In March it felt like it was time to leave Europe and the comforts of the western world, so embarked on a two week trip through Morocco with Grace. We loved Spain and could have spent longer there, but we were running short on days with our visa, so we flew to Croatia. We landed in Dubrovnik, and, while we enjoyed a peaceful few days as we recovered from the flu, we eventually felt restless in the small, over-touristy town. We had also become accustomed to a faster pace travelling Morocco, and with the end of our trip in sight, wanted to see a little more. So, we thought, "W_hat if we rent a car and head a little more off the beaten path?"_ Two days later, we were speeding off in our little white Citroen, on a one-month road trip through the Balkans!

## The Plan

We’ll fill you in on some of the details in future posts, but for now, hopefully this overview gives you a flavour of the trip.
