> “The sea can do craziness, it can do smooth, it can lie down like silk breathing or toss havoc shoreward; it can give gifts or withhold all; it can rise, ebb, froth like an incoming frenzy of fountains, or it can sweet-talk entirely. As I can too, and so, no doubt, can you, and you.” ― Mary Oliver, A Thousand Mornings

We last left off in Almograve after two days and 48km hiking along the Rota Vicentina. We pick back up in Almograve for two more days and 41km of tranquility and ocean views.

## Day 3: Almograve to Zambujeira do Mar

Starting town: Almograve\
Ending town: Zambujeira do Mar\
Distance hiked: 21.5km\
Trail time: 9:20 to 15:45

We started out earlier today with the hopes of getting to enjoy Zambujeira do Mar in the daylight. We had noticed a bakery in town the evening prior and hoped that we could pick up a tasty breakfast treat. Alas, it wasn’t open, which didn’t surprise us at this point in our trip as a lot of establishments in these towns seem to shut down entirely during the off-season. Good thing we had some roasted almonds and snack bars to get us through until dinner!

Almograve is back a little from the coast, so we had a kilometre of walking before we reunited with the ocean. W-e-l-c-o-m-e b-a-c-k good friend!

All morning we were served stunning views of the Atlantic ocean with monumental cliffs in the foreground. And bonus, we had soft sand underfoot; I could hear my feet whispering _thank you!_

The wind was a little stronger today, and as a result, the waves were mesmerizing. Many additional pauses were required to watch them roll in, ascend, curl over, collapse, and then crash into the cliffs. Over, and over again. Never letting up.

We couldn’t get enough of these cliffs with their layers of beauty. Can you spot the Z?

With three kilometres to go the path passed by a small fishing harbour, and then continued for 2km alongside a small local road. On the outskirts of town the path ventured back to the coast for a last hurrah to end the spectacular day.

Felt great to be in town so early, AND with such great access to views! Zambujeira do Mar sits right on the ocean and so we were excited to spend some time sitting while taking in the sun and ocean.

We watched the sun go down over the beach and the crashing waves as we drank cold beers and munched on our chips. Pure perfection. We both agreed this was a highlight moment of the hike.

For dinner, we had a recommendation from our hostel host.

“It’s the place my father goes to drink beer and watch the football. It’s not fancy, but their food is tasty and it’s cheap.”  

His description was SO accurate. We entered the restaurant, and sat down in a ‘normal’ way - facing each other with the table in between. I very quickly realized I was the only one in the restaurant not facing the tv where the football match was playing. Eventually I just embraced it and turned my back on Tim to also face the tv. _Happy Valentine’s Day love!_
