> I can’t think of anything that excites a greater sense of childlike wonder than to be in a country where you are ignorant of almost everything. Suddenly you are five years old again. You can’t read anything, you have only the most rudimentary sense of how things work, you can’t even reliably cross a street without endangering your life. Your whole existence becomes a series of interesting guesses. - Bill Bryson

## The trio unites

Tim and I are in the basement of the Casablanca International airport, having taken the train in from the city centre to meet my sister, Grace, arriving from Ottawa. We are standing in line to go through security to get to the arrivals area, which seems to be taking forever. 

I look up, and see Grace descending the elevator, beaming a beautiful smile and radiating with energy. My heart leaps. I am filled with joy, and rush forward for a big embrace.

Our two week adventure as a travelling trio begins! 

## Our two week itinerary

Over the next two weeks, Tim, Grace and I experienced Morocco - it’s people, food, landscapes, and culture. More to come on those experiences, but here is the bird’s eye view and short summary of our two-week adventure through Morocco:

1. Essaouira
2. The Atlas Mountains (Imlil and Mount Toubkal)
3. Marrakech
4. The Desert (M’Hamid and Erg Chigaga)
5. Casablanca
