Lisbon has been a great city to start our four month European adventure. Spending two weeks here has given us the opportunity to travel slowly, spending time getting lost in Lisbon’s windy streets, going up and down the city’s never ending hills, and spending afternoons in coffee shops and parks. Here are our top five favourite things to do in Lisbon.

## 1. Wander the streets and stumble upon a miradouro

Lisbon’s streets are beautiful to meander through. You have to be prepared for a hill workout, but will be rewarded with lovely tiled sidewalks underfoot, brightly coloured buildings, many with tiled facades, and numerous lookouts (miradouros) with views of the city and river.

There are many great viewpoints, but our favourite was Miradoura Santa Luzia, because of the beautiful gardens that accompany the view.

## 2. Drink espresso in one of Lisbon’s many parks

When your legs need a break from Lisbon’s hills, take a stop at a coffee kiosk in one of Lisbon’s many parks. These permanent coffee stands are often very reasonably priced, and are the perfect spot to soak up the sun and watch the world go by.

Our favourite is close to our apartment, in the Principal Real Garden. We get the impression that this parked is loved by its neighbourhood’s residents, not just tourists, as evidence by the card tournaments that happen in the west end of the park, and the number of children making use of the play structures. Try and grab a spot in the sun, and maybe bring your cribbage board with you for a quick game in the park. They also have public tables on the West end of the park, where we enjoyed a picnic dinner one evening.
